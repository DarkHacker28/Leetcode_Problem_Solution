# Leetcode_Daily_Problems

This repository contains my daily LeetCode solutions. I am committed to improving my problem-solving skills by solving one LeetCode problem every day and documenting my progress here. Each solution is written in C++, and I aim to cover a variety of problem types to build a strong foundation in algorithms and data structures.

## Objective

- Solve one LeetCode problem every day.
- Showcase my progress, understanding, and the techniques I use to solve problems.
- Improve my problem-solving speed and ability to approach different types of challenges.
- Share solutions with the community and gain feedback for continuous improvement.

## Repository Structure

- Each day's solution is organized in its respective folder, named with the format `DayX`, where `X` is the day number.
- The folder contains:
  - A `.cpp` file with the solution for that day's problem.
  - A `README.md` file describing the problem, approach, and solution.
  - Additional notes or improvements, if any, to optimize the solution.


Every folder will also have the problem description and my thought process for solving the problem.

## My Progress

I am dedicated to keeping this up to date, and you can track my journey by looking at the commits made daily. Each commit corresponds to the solution for that day's problem.

## Technologies Used

- C++ (for solving LeetCode problems)
- Git (for version control)
- GitHub (for showcasing my progress)
